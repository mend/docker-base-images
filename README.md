# mend/docker-base-images

This repository contains Docker base images for some Mend.io products.

Dockerfiles in this repository should include only Open Source tools and no proprietary Mend.io logic.
They are published to Docker Hub to be used by end users to build the final images without needing to install every tool locally.
